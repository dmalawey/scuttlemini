# Design
_The designs as of 2025 are working designs.  Working docs are for distributing robot modules between collaborators, but the designs may be pre-prototype and untested._

# Intentions
_Design intentions discussion here.  For the full design, the intent must be decided collaboratively.  For the design of modules, a respective expert can make initial targets & describe design intent in this section.

### Goals

> Key Goals for Design
>
> * Support low-cost, repeatable build from the ground-up in any global region.
> * Generate a minimal viable DDMR configuration for 10kg payload
> * Fully modular design: every part belongs to a subassembly which has utility or testable goals independent of the full robot
> * Minimize custom parts: The robot is a custom design but the parts should be standard, as much as possible
> * Commonization:  Aim to match SCUTTLE original modules in design details for: Selection of hardware, wiring configuration, etc.
> * Outsourced Data: for each module and each part, we use well-documented selections, and design choices backed by ubiquitous data.
> * Ownership of design: each module can be traced to an "owner" who fully understands the module & can produce documentation
>
