## Ben10 Team
_A brief introduction to the team based in Malaysia's UTP, collaborating with David M and SCUTTLE engineers for 2025 outcomes._

We are excited about the opportunity to be part of an initiative that aims to make robotics more accessible and affordable. Our team consists of four members with expertise in various fields. I have decided to name my team "UTP Ben10" for this exciting collaboration. The name "Ben10" is inspired by the character from the animated series who can transform into different forms, symbolizing this project adaptability. The number "10" represents our project goal of achieving a 10 kg payload capacity for the SCUTTLE Mini.

**Our Team**
* An image processing expert (Nazeem)
* An autonomous navigation expert (Nik_Robothon participant)
* An energy consumption and generation expert (Faiz)
* An online data monitoring expert (Ibnu_Great challenge finalist)

> **Intro**
> 
> We are particularly interested in integrating our systems into the SCUTTLE Mini. We will provide your team with a detailed methodology as required. We plan to develop two systems using one chassis to demonstrate the design's ease of modification by users. Our current project is a hazardous delivery robot, and I plan to start a domestic drain cleaning system after our current project assessment for my FYP Project.
Additionally, I am one of the participants in Robothon, and one of our team members is a finalist for the Great Challenge. We believe our experience and skills can significantly contribute to the success of the SCUTTLE Mini project.
Our goals align with SCUTTLE's objective to create a 10kg load SCUTTLE Mini version. We are eager to collaborate and help achieve this target. We have attached the current system pictures and video, but we need a new chassis for this system so that the robot can carry more loads on ramp. Our project objective is to develop an autonomous delivery robot, and we aim to ensure a high weight of load per robot weight ratio.
Please let us know how we can get involved and contribute to the project's success. We are looking forward to the possibility of collaborating with the SCUTTLE community.

* **Straight Path (3 meters):** The robot must travel 3 meters straight, detecting and following the black line using IR sensors.
* **Ramp Ascent (30-degree):** The robot will ascend a 1-meter ramp, transitioning from a flat surface to an incline. The IR sensors will ensure the robot stays on course during the ascent.
* **Turn:** After the ramp, the robot will perform a sharp-turn, maintaining path adherence via the IR sensors.
* **Ramp Descent (30-degree):** The robot will navigate a 1-meter ramp, transitioning from a flat surface to a downward slope.
* **Obstacle Avoidance:** At the halfway point along the straight path (after the ramp), an obstacle will be placed to test the robot's ability to detect and avoid the object using the HC-SR04P ultrasonic sensors. Positioned to detect obstacles at a 15 cm threshold. The robot will autonomously change its path to avoid obstacles while ensuring the container remains upright.
